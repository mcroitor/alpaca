### Quality Levels

- **Excellent (9-10 points)**: Perfect implementation following best practices
- **Good (7-8 points)**: Correct implementation with minor improvements possible  
- **Satisfactory (4-6 points)**: Partially correct, shows understanding but has issues

### Evaluator Guidelines

- **Partial Credit**: Award partial points when requirements are attempted but not fully correct (e.g., 5 points for partially correct implementations)
- **Innovation Bonus**: Consider additional bonus points for creative solutions that exceed requirements (multi-stage builds, security improvements, etc.)
- **Documentation**: Small bonus points for helpful comments explaining choices
- **Dockerfile Best Practices**: Consider bonus points for following Docker best practices (layer optimization, security, etc.)
- **Functionality**: Test the Dockerfile by building the image when possible
- **Consistency**: Use this rubric consistently across all student submissions
