The main issues in the student's response are:
- Missing quotes around CMD arguments, which will cause a syntax error
- Using CMD instead of ENTRYPOINT for the entry command
- In Copy Requirements instruction, incorrect destination path (missing trailing slash)

The solution is mostly correct but would not function as expected due to these critical errors.
