The student response shows several issues:
- Missing the `FROM` directive for base image
- Incorrect syntax for environment variables (using ARG instead of ENV)
- Hardcoded paths without using variables where needed
- Using shell commands directly instead of RUN command
- Missing VOLUME directive
- Expose/ENTRYPOINT written in lowercase which won't execute properly

The solution needs significant restructuring to follow proper Dockerfile syntax and best practices.
