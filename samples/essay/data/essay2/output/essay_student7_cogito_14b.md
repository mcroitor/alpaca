Total Score: 83/100

Key issues:
- WORKDIR uses variable name without ${} (minor)
- Missing --no-cache-dir spelling (--cacge-dir instead of --no-cache-dir) (-2 points from 9 to 7)
- COPY application uses /app directly instead of APP_DIR variable (partial credit)
- EXPOSE port incorrectly specifies 8000:80 which may not work as intended
- ENTRYPOINT lacks array format but functionally correct

The Dockerfile is mostly correct with minor syntax issues and some hardcoded paths where variables should be used.
